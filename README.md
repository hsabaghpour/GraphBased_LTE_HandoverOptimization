Graph-Based LTE Handover Optimization

Overview

This repository contains two approaches for optimizing handover success rates in an LTE network by optimizing Neighbor (NBR) relations between eNodeBs using graph-based techniques. The goal is to enhance the handover process by improving successful handovers between eNodeBs while removing or adjusting overshooting NBR relations and adding missing NBR relations.

Problem Statement

In LTE networks, handovers are a critical aspect of ensuring continuous connectivity as users move between cells. By representing eNodeBs as nodes and NBR relations (handover success rates) as edges, we aim to optimize these relations through graph-based solutions. The two approaches used are:

	1.	Graph Machine Learning
	2.	Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

1. Handover Success Rate Optimization using Graph-Based Machine Learning

This approach models the LTE network as a graph, where:

	•	Nodes represent eNodeBs (base stations).
	•	Edges represent NBR relations between eNodeBs, weighted by the handover success rate.

Key Steps:

	•	Graph Construction: Create a graph of eNodeBs and their NBR relations using NetworkX.
	•	Overshooting NBR Removal: Remove NBR relations with a low handover success rate (overshooting relations).
	•	Adding Missing NBRs: Introduce missing NBR relations to improve connectivity.
	•	Machine Learning (Logistic Regression): Train a logistic regression model using features such as node degree and edge weights to predict whether a handover will be successful or not.
	•	Optimization: The model is used to remove unsuccessful NBR relations and maintain successful ones.

Key Libraries:

	•	NetworkX: For graph creation and manipulation.
	•	scikit-learn (Logistic Regression): For machine learning-based optimization of NBR relations.

2. Handover Optimization using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This approach uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to optimize the handover success rates by learning representations of eNodeBs (nodes) and NBR relations (edges).

Key Steps:

	•	Graph Construction: The LTE network is represented as a graph using NetworkX.
	•	GNN Model (GCNConv): A two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to process the graph and learn node and edge representations.
	•	Training: The GCN is trained to predict successful and unsuccessful handovers based on node features and edge weights.
	•	Prediction: The model outputs predictions that help optimize NBR relations by removing unsuccessful handovers and adding successful ones.

Key Libraries:

	•	PyTorch Geometric: For building and training the Graph Neural Network.
	•	NetworkX: For graph creation and conversion to a PyTorch Geometric-compatible format.
